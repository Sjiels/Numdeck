# Numdeck
A cheap way to use your numpad as a streamdeck.


Welcome to the NUMDECK. The Numdeck is a program that can be used on windows to make your Numpad turn into a streamdeck, you see where I got the name from? ;)
Rather than to rip off the keycaps and put LED screens on your numpad the app will show all the changable icons and current page. Much like the streamdeck you are able to create different pages and cycle through them. 

For inital realease there will not be a UI to assign functions to the keys. It will just be coded. Due to the license you are allowed to download this app and code it in whatever way you'd like. **Please note that any changes you make have to be documented. 

In future versions I do plan to add the feature to be able to adjust the button actions from within the app, but I really don't know how long it'll take me to even make an initial release. So if you are waiting for that I am very sorry.

For now I will post beta versions of the app here, please note that the code might be very silly and that it might not work. Downloading any of the pre 1.0 versions is at own risk of your pc. Not that I expect it to crash/die, but better to be saf than sorry. 

For questions about how to link the app to your OBS I would recommend you to watch this video: https://youtu.be/1x3QqZHr6IY . Nutty released the app: NoobsCommander, which basically allows you to make shortcuts for your OBS. Now this app was coded with the intention of opening NoobsCommander files to do things inside of OBS. So you will probably need this. However if you were able to figure out another way of how to use Numdeck to do things in OBS please let me know as it might be easier and could be integrated in a future release. Also if you'd like another way to use your numpad or any keyboard to your OBS check this video: https://youtu.be/jdI_IeP1K3o. I am just building this app  because I'm looking for shit to do and I have too much free time. 

If you have any questions you can send me a PM on discord; Sjiels#3528. If you encounter bug please report it in the Issues tab and If you might find an easier way to do something or want a new feature leave them in the Pull requests.
